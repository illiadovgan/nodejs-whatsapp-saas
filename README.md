# Free WhatsApp NodeJS Bot (Whapi.Cloud WhatsApp API)
This example of the WhatsApp bot implementation touches in detail on the most frequently used functionality: send message, send file, create group, send message to WhatsApp Group. This will allow you to adapt WhatsApp API and source code to your tasks and needs, or take it as a basis for creating any other integration.
In the source code of the bot you will find the following functionality:
<ul>
  <li class="d-flex">Send regular text message;</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Send media: image / file / video;</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Send contact (vCard);</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Send product;</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Create new group, send an invitation and send message to the group;</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Receive and reading incoming messages;</li>
  <li class="d-flex">Respond to an unfamiliar command, this could be an instruction or your welcome message;</li>
</ul>

You will be able to use our source code in your project, easily modifying and supplementing the script's functionality. Based on the code, you can create your chatbot or any integration. Easily integrate it into existing workflows, continuing to use WhatsApp as usual!
